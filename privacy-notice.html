                <h2>International data transfers</h2>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>
                <p>Specifically, our servers are located around the world, and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of these countries.</p>

                <p>If you are a resident of the EU or the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;) we may transfer personal data outside the EU/EEA when trusted service providers or partners are established there. To the extent personal data is transferred to a country outside of the EU/EEA, we will use the required established mechanisms that allow the transfer to these third countries, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>

                <p>We retain personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need or legal obligation to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
                <p>When your personal data is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes defined in this Privacy Notice, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                  <li>If processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. The withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out before the withdrawal; and</li>
                  <li>The right to data portability, i.e. right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and transmit the personal data to another data controller, to the extent required by applicable law. This applies for personal data processed based on contract or your consent.</li>
                </ul>
